Solutions to the exercises given in the book "C Programming: A Modern Approach" by K.N.King. This is to learn c programming well btw and some chapters might not contain solutions to all exercises in part cause I was a bit lazy and skipped after doing a few.

However, this only contains the solutions to the programming projects section of the exercises. I will do the other exercises if I am in the mood lol(or as revision once I've done more than half the book).

BTW I am also using this to learn vim to eventually use it as my main editor so the formatting might differ in certain files due to that.
