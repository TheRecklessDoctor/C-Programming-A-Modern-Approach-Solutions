#  Note

I did not look at exercises 12.1-12.4 properly before coding them out therefore all I saw when doing 12.1 and 12.2 were that pointers had to be used. Therefore I used the array name as a pointer method from the outset which was supposed to be used for 12.3 and 12.4.

Therefore 12.1 and 12.3 are in the same file just in two seperate functions with comments as are 12.2 and 12.4.
